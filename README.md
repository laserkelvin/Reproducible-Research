# Reproducible Research with Python

This repository is a Jupyter notebook presentation that introduces some
concepts to the reproducible research using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

The talk is divided into sections, first introducing the current problem
with reproducibility in scientific research, followed by identifying the ways
that we can try and fix the problem. There is a component of interactivity
built into this workshop, where I like to pose the question to attendees
how confident they are that their own research is immediately reproducible
on a local (i.e. by themselves) and global (by others) level.

The last part of the talk is a walkthrough some of the tools that can be
used to help make research reproducible and sharable, using Github and Binder.

To give the talk, you must have RISE installed - you can grab it at https://github.com/damianavila/RISE

Alternatively, find it on Binder:
